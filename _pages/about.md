I am a final year undergraduate student, pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kancheepuram. I like Machine Learning and I like it more when it actually works on devices. I discovered that Deep Learning can do amazing stuff when applied to biosignals (if you can make it work). I'm trying to make that my career path and I'm excited for the future. When I'm not working, I am either riffing on my guitar or convincing myself to get back to work while clicking on another John Oliver video.
