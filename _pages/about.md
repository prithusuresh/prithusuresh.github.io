I am a final year undergraduate student, pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at <a href = "https://www.srmist.edu.in/" target = "_blank">SRM Institute of Science and Technology </a>, Kancheepuram. I love working on applications of Machine Learning in developing prototypes for social good. Unlike most people in the industry, my prediliction for tech surfaced quite recently. Since then I've grown rapidly in size, character and knowledge, the last two enabling me to discover (and rediscover) a gargantuan number of topics that potentially interest me. This ability to seamlessly transition into new areas of interest has allowed me to explore a huge breadth of topics from Image processing to Machine Learning on edge devices. My most recent interest lies in the intersection of Machine Learning and Biosignals, with a focus on developing quantized models for resource scarce devices. When I'm not working, I am either riffing on my guitar or convincing myself to get back to work while clicking on another John Oliver video.
